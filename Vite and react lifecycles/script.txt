"Hi, in this video I’ll explain how React makes building web applications easier and what problems it solves compared to using just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  

Issues with vinallia js 
1. code becomes messy  (namipulation)
2. repitition of code  (navbar) 
3. hard to maintain -> changing one part of the UI can affect multiples files
4. Poor user experience -> Manual dom updates can make the app slower.



How reacr helps 
1. Components – We can break the UI into small, reusable pieces. For example, a button or a navbar can be created once and reused anywhere.

2. Virtual dom-> Instead of updating the real DOM directly, React uses a Virtual DOM. It updates only the parts of the page that actually changed, making the app faster.
3. State management -> React allows us to manage data easily with the help of state. when data changes react automatically re-renders the  updated part only.
4. Easier to maintain -> Since the UI is broken into independent components, the code is cleaner and easier to debug."
