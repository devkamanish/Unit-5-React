React Dom -> It is basically a bridge between your code and actual dom(browser dom) and that react dom manages how to do operations on actual dom .

Why react is considered declarative?
-> It describes what the UI should look like and react handles the updates.

Props-> Data pass to components using attributes. 
Porps pass data from parent component to child component 


useState -> It is hook in react that is capable to store the memory
If you want to update the UI when a variable changes, use useState.
If we use variables then we loose the data because variable don't persist across rerenders.

VDom -> When react loads it creates virtual copy of actual dom.


Reconcillation-> It happens in two phase 
1. Render phase : All the state updates and function calls are noted.
2. commit phase : react will applyy the changes at once.

Reconciliation in React is the process of updating the real DOM to match the virtual DOM. so whenever there is a change in state, react compares the new virtual DOM with the previous one and updates only the changed parts of the real DOM.


React use batch update if there are multiple state updates in a single event or a function.
