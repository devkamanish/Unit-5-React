React Dom -> It is basically a bridge between your code and actual dom(browser dom) and that react dom manages how to do operations on actual dom .

Why react is considered declarative?
-> It describes what the UI should look like and react handles the updates.

Props-> Data pass to components using attributes. 
Porps pass data from parent component to child component 


useState -> It is hook in react that is capable to store the memory
If you want to update the UI when a variable changes, use useState.
If we use variables then we loose the data because variable don't persist across rerenders.
