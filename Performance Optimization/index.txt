-> In React, memoization means caching the result of a function or component rendering so that it doesn’t recompute unless its inputs change. 

React.memo → Memoizes functional components.
useMemo → Memoizes expensive calculations.
useCallback → Memoizes functions to prevent re-creation on every render.


UseEffect is for sideeffects and runs when the component is mounted whereas useMemo runs durinng the render phase and it is for performance upgradation which simply handle unneccessary re-renders.
