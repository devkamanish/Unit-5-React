Learned how to build a custom React hook (useToggleItems) for managing state across an array.

Understood the use of useState to track the current position and cycle through items.

Practiced creating a reusable, generic hook that accepts parameters and returns both state and a toggle function.

Reinforced concepts of array traversal, modular arithmetic, and circular toggling logic.

Gained confidence in using hooks to encapsulate reusable logic cleanly across components.
